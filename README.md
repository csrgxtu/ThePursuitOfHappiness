###  ThePursuitOfHappiness
The pursuit of knowledge actually is the pursuit of happiness for me. You got a very big plan for yourself, but you got to do it one by one seriously.

Inspired by [jwasham](https://github.com/jwasham), he started a studying plan called [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university),and that repository contains a lot serious yet interesting things about computer science. meantime, i always reading books, do experiments, but without writing down any notes about the feelings or the opinions, so without this good habit when learning something, i always forget it quickly, even cant explain the detailed basic ideas behind the knowledge afterwards.

so here i will use GitHub store the resources when i am leanring, use this repositories's issues for small questions and puzzles, use my blog [csrgxtu](http://csrgxtu.github.io) as reading notes.
